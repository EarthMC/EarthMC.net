                The act of tricking players into teleporting to a specific location or person just to kill or trap them is not allowed. This used to be allowed but a lot of players abused it to the degree players voted to forbid it.<br>
                <br/>
                Normal traps that don't involve players blindly teleporting into them and any traps constructed in a warzone are allowed however, as long as the player doesn't get stuck for a longer period of time (10 - 15 minutes or more).

            <h2>3. Griefing</h2>
            <ul>
              <li id="3.1">
                <b>3.1 Destroying land in or around claims</b><br/>
                Players may not damage land in or around claims (griefing). Players breaking this rule will be warned and damage will be rolled back. Players doing this more than once may face a permanent ban. Placing and removing blocks during siege war events is allowed when necessary to the extent needed in the conflict.
                <br>
                Examples of grief:
                <ul class="innerul">
                  <li>Cobble monsters - Mountain-like structures that are built using lava and water.</li>
                  <li>Lava/water curtains - Placing rows of lava/water in the sky to make a wall of falling lava.</li>
                  <li>TNT craters.</li>
                  <li>Mass spawning entities within or around a town (Chickens, Boats, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li id="3.2">
                <b>3.2	Destroying land in wilderness</b><br/>
                Wilderness is defined by Towny as any land not currently claimed. You are allowed to grief structures or terrain as long as they are not within or in close proximity to a claimed area.
                However, any player may request major terrain grief to be rolled back even in the wilderness.<br>
                <br>
                Breaking railways or ice roads is not allowed even in the wilderness, if willingly connecting two existing towns. This does not only apply to the rails but all blocks the railroad is made of.
              </li>
              <li id="3.3">
                <b>3.3	Town claims</b><br/>
                Towns are not allowed to have areas of unclaimed chunks inside of their borders as this can substantially increase the size of a town without them actually having to increase their claim limit legitimately.<br>
                <br>
                Surrounding other towns with claims is also not allowed, about 3/4 of the town has to be surrounded for it to count as illegal. The only exception to this is when a town is created in an area where it is already surrounded. 
              </li>
              <li id="3.4">
                <b>3.4  Stealing specific blocks</b><br/>
                Stealing specific blocks for their value is not considered grief and is therefore allowed. This does not apply to easily acquired blocks even if they are valuable to you.
              </li>
              <li id="3.5">
                <b>3.5  Major terraforming</b><br/>
                In order to preserve the accurate geography of the map, major terraforming of the natural terrain is not allowed. In general, if your edits of the landscape alter the Dynmap view of the natural landscape, they will be removed.
                Examples of this includes for instance draining large lakes/rivers, creating artificial islands which do not exist in real life, or covering the ocean with platforms. Vertical terraforming is allowed as it does not change the dynmap view.
              </li>
              <li id="3.6">
                <b>3.6  Map art</b><br/>
                Creating map art is allowed as long as it does not interfere with other towns. It is recommended to place map art in Antarctica as there is a lot of unused space there.
                If you place it outside of Antarctica you will have to claim the area as it will count as proximity greifing if the other towns around you don't like it.<br/>
                <br/>
                Your map art may not contain nudity, sexual content, racist imagery or anything else that breaks any part of rule 2.

                <p>
                  Anyone who holds the Mod, Dev, Admin or Owner rank is considered server staff. Plugin developers are not server staff although they may have access to support tickets so they can use your feedback to improve their plugins.
