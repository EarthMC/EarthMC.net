        <h2>2. Behavior and chat</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>2.1  TP killing.</b> TP killing is the act of tricking a player in to accepting your teleportation request with the purpose of killing them. Although frown upon it is still allowed as it is up to each player whether or not to accept the teleportation request.</li>
            <li><b>2.2	Stealing and raiding players/towns/nations.</b> Stealing and raiding other players is allowed. It’s up to each and every player to protect their assets.  </li>
            <li><b>2.3	Spam.</b> Spamming or sending messages in a way that disrupts chat flow, normally by sending a similar message repeatedly, is not allowed. Spammers may be warned and temporarily muted. Time muted range between 15 minutes to days depending on severity and frequency of such actions.</li>
            <li><b>2.4	Toxicity.</b> Toxicity is not allowed on this server. Toxicity is the act of continuously using racial slurs, sexual harassment or severely explicit language in a way that drives players away from the community. Toxicity is declared on a case-by-case basis by staff. First offenders will be warned or otherwise contacted by staff to let them know when they have broken this rule.

Offenders will be asked to revert to their proper character. If any damage is done staff may choose to ban the offending player.</li>
            <li><b>2.6	AFK farming.</b> Standing in a farm “away from keyboard” is currently allowed provided that no other rules are broken in the process (see rule 1.1). You may be kicked if server needs to free up space and resources for actively playing users.</li>
            <li><b>2.7	Sharing personal information.</b> Sharing personal information and identities of others without their explicit permission is strictly forbidden.

            <li><b>2.11	Language in global chat channels.</b> When speaking in either the global chat or the donator chat channel you should stick to English only.

        <section>
        <h2>3. Griefing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>3.1	Destroying land around claims.</b> Players may not damage terrain around claims (griefing). Players breaking this rule will be warned and damage will be rolled back. Players doing this more than once may face a permanent ban. Please note that mayors/kings are responsible for misconfigured town/nation permission settings. Examples of grief:</li>
            <ul class="innerul">
                <li>Cobble monsters - Mountain-like structures that are built using lava and water.</li>
                <li>Lava/water curtains - Placing rows of lava/water in the sky to make a wall of falling lava.</li>
                <li>TNT craters.</li>
                <li>Mass spawning entities within or around a town (Chickens, Boats, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>3.2	Destroying land in wilderness.</b> Wilderness is defined by Towny as any land not currently claimed. You are allowed to grief structures or terrain as long as they are not within or in close proximity to a claimed area. However, any player may request grief to be rolled back even in the wilderness.</b>
Breaking railways is not allowed even in the wilderness if willingly connecting two existing towns. This does not only apply to the rails but all blocks the railroad is made of.
            </li>
            <li><b>3.3	Claim blocking.</b> “Claim blocking” is referring to the act of deliberately placing outposts near a town in order to block its expansion. This is not allowed since town expansion is prioritized over outpost expansion. Placing outposts over abandoned towns is also considered claim blocking, these areas are supposed to be left for new mayors. Towns placed close to other towns are not subject to this rule as both parties have equal right to the land. Players reporting a claim block must have a sincere intention to expand in that direction and are expected to do so after blocking claim is removed. All claims which staff concludes to be blocking a town will be removed without any refund. Players found to be claim blocking more than once may be warned and denied the ability to place outposts all together. </li>
            <li><b>3.4  Stealing specific blocks.</b> Stealing specific blocks for their value is not considered grief and is therefore allowed. This does not apply to easily acquired blocks even if they are valuable to you.</li>
            <li><b>3.5  Major terraforming.</b> In order to preserve the accurate geography of the map, major terraforming projects are not allowed. In general, if your edits of the landscape alter the dynmap view of the natural landscape, they will be removed. Examples of this include but are not limited to: Draining large lakes/rivers, creating artificial islands that do not exist in real life, and covering the ocean with platforms.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>
        <h2>4. Towny names</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>4.1  Nation names.</b> Before creating a nation, make sure your name complies with the nation naming rules. Nation names may be changed by a staff member if rule is not followed.</li>
            <ul class="innerul">
                <li>Nation name cannot be fictional. It has to have the same name as a current or past nation.</li>
                <li>Nation name must correspond with map location of the nation capital. </li>
                <li>Nation cannot be named after unions.</li>
                <li>Nation cannot be named after alliances.</li>
                <li>Nation cannot be named after a continent.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>4.2	Town names.</b> Before creating a town, make sure your name complies with the town naming rules. Town names may be changed by a staff member if rule is not followed.</li>
            <ul class="innerul">
                <li>Fictional town names are allowed. However, we highly recommend towns to have a name tied to the real life town location.</li>
                <li>Town name cannot be inappropriate/toxic/offensive.</li>
                <li>Town cannot be named after current or past nation.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
