                <h2>2. Behavior and chat</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>2.1  TP killing.</b> TP killing is the act of tricking a player in to accepting your teleportation request with the purpose of killing them. Although frowned upon it is still allowed as it is up to each player whether or not to accept the teleportation request.</li>
                    <li><b>2.2	Stealing and raiding players/towns/nations.</b> Stealing and raiding other players is allowed. It’s up to each and every player to protect their assets.  </li>
                    <li><b>2.3	Spam.</b> Spamming or sending messages in a way that disrupts chat flow, normally by sending a similar message repeatedly, is not allowed.

Toxicity is declared on a case-by-case basis by staff. First offenders will be warned or otherwise contacted by staff to let them know when they have broken this rule.

            <h2>3. Griefing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>3.1	Griefing and destroying land around claims.</b> Players may not damage terrain or structures around or in claims against the owners will, this act is referred to as griefing and is not allowed on this server. Players breaking this rule will be warned and damage will be rolled back. Players doing this more than once or if the grief is considered major may face a permanent ban. Please note that mayors/kings are responsible for misconfigured town/nation permission settings. Examples of grief:</li>
                <ul class="innerul">
                    <li>Cobble monsters - Mountain-like structures that are built using lava and water.</li>
                    <li>Lava/water curtains - Placing rows of lava/water in the sky to make a wall of falling lava/water.</li>
                    <li>TNT craters.</li>
                    <li>Mass spawning entities within or around a town (Chickens, Boats, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>3.2	Destroying land in wilderness.</b> Wilderness is defined by Towny as any land not currently claimed. You are allowed to grief structures or terrain as long as they are not within or in close proximity to a claimed area. However, any player may request grief to be rolled back even in the wilderness.</li>

                <li><b>3.3	Claim blocking.</b> “Claim blocking” is referring to the act of deliberately placing outposts or towns near another town to block its expansion. This is not allowed. This rule is in place to ensure that all players have room to play on the map. Players reporting a claim block must have a sincere intention to expand in that direction and are expected to do so after blocking claim is removed. There are three possible scenarios when it comes to claim blocking:</li>
                <ul class="innerul">
                    <li><b>Outpost blocking town:</b> In this case the outpost will be removed, town expansion is prioritized since each player can have many outposts but only one town. Staff will remove the outpost if certain requirements are met. Town claims must be right up against the outpost. In addition, if the outpost was placed before the town was funded there must also be things built in the claim right up against the outpost to the center of the town. If this isn’t the case staff finds it hard to justify that you really need the outpost claim. </li>
                    <li><b>Town blocking another town:</b> In general, each town has equal access to claim nearby land and staff will therefore not intervene. Europe is a good example of this, barely any land is left yet claims are not removed. However, staff may act if a town is deliberately placed for the sole purpose of blocking or otherwise harass neighboring town. Amongst other reasons, staff will consider towns that claim around other towns, towns that are inappropriately close to another town in relation to the space available a bit further away, towns that have few residents but rapid expansion close to another town and towns that are claimed in unnatural shapes. It’s up to staff to conclude whether a town is blocking another town. Staff will contact the mayor and ask the mayor to move. Staff may or may not refund the town depending on the situation. </li>
                    <li><b>Outposts on abandoned towns:</b> Placing outposts over abandoned towns is also considered claim blocking, these areas are supposed to be left for new mayors to claim.</li>
                </ul>

                <li><b>3.4  Stealing specific blocks.</b> Stealing specific blocks for their value is not considered grief and is therefore allowed. This does not apply to easily acquired blocks even if they are valuable to you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How and where do I appeal my punishment?</h3>

            <p>Please join our main discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/vJTta6M">here</a> and start a new support ticket by running the command “-new”. A separate text channel will be provided named after your ticket number. You do not have to wait for staff to reply here, instead provide as much evidence as you have of the player and which rules are broken from the list above.</p>

            <p>Everyone playing on EarthMC Minecraft server or anyone part of our discord server is a player. Players cover all ranks.</p>
