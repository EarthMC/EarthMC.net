        <h2>2. Behavior and chat</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>2.1 TP killing.</b><br/>
                TP killing is the act of tricking a player in to accepting your teleportation request with the purpose of killing them.
                Although frowned upon it is still allowed as it is up to each player whether or not to accept the teleportation request. Repeatedly doing it to everyone who joins however may be classed as toxicity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2.2 Stealing and raiding players/towns/nations.</b><br/>
                Stealing and raiding other players is allowed. It’s up to each and every player to protect their assets.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2.3 Spam.</b><br/>
                Spamming or sending messages in a way that disrupts chat flow, normally by sending a similar message repeatedly, is not allowed. Spammers may be warned and temporarily muted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2.4 Toxicity.</b><br/>
                Toxicity is not allowed on this server. Toxicity in chat can be for instance using racial slurs, sexual harassment or severely explicit language.
                It can also be other non-chat actions which drive players away from the community, for instance luring newly joined players to your town so you can kill them or lock them in your town jail.<br/>
                <br/>
                Toxicity is determined on a case-by-case basis by staff.  Repeated violations may lead to warnings, mutes and eventually a permanent ban.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2.5 Impersonating other players, towns and nations.</b><br/>
                Impersonating players by taking advantage of, but not limited to, usernames, nicknames, town/nation names is not allowed.
                Offenders will be asked to revert to their proper character. If any damage is done staff may choose to ban the offending player.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2.6 AFK time.</b><br/>
                You are not allowed to be AFK more than 15 minutes, if you are found using a method of circumventing the auto-kicking staff will take action.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2.7 Sharing personal information.</b><br/>
                Sharing personal information and identities of others without their explicit permission is strictly forbidden.
                Personal information may be, but not limited to, “real life” photos of players, phone numbers, home addresses, social networks, school/work location, family relations and IP-addresses.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2.8 Sharing links</b><br/>
                Malicious links are not allowed, this includes for instance viruses or ip loggers. Links which contribute to breaking any of the rules listed on this page are not allowed. Linking to adult content is not allowed. Other links are allowed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2.9 Advertising.</b><br/>
                Advertising is not allowed unless it’s related to the server. Advertisers will be muted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2.10	Selling content and services for real money.</b><br/>
                You are not allowed to sell in-game items or services for real life money, or vice-versa.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2.11	Language in global chat channels.</b><br/>
                When speaking in either the global chat or the donator chat channel you should stick to English only. You can use other private chat channels for other languages such as town chat or private messages.
                If there are only or almost only players who also speak your language online you are allowed to speak it in the global channels too.

        <h2>3. Griefing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>3.1	Destroying land around claims.</b><br/>
                Players may not damage terrain around claims (griefing). Players breaking this rule will be warned and damage will be rolled back. Players doing this more than once may face a permanent ban.
                Please note that mayors/kings are responsible for misconfigured town/nation permission settings. Examples of grief:
                <ul class="innerul">
                    <li>Cobble monsters - Mountain-like structures that are built using lava and water.</li>
                    <li>Lava/water curtains - Placing rows of lava/water in the sky to make a wall of falling lava.</li>
                    <li>TNT craters.</li>
                    <li>Mass spawning entities within or around a town (Chickens, Boats, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>3.2	Destroying land in wilderness.</b><br/>
                Wilderness is defined by Towny as any land not currently claimed. You are allowed to grief structures or terrain as long as they are not within or in close proximity to a claimed area. However, any player may request grief to be rolled back even in the wilderness.
                Breaking railways is not allowed even in the wilderness if willingly connecting two existing towns. This does not only apply to the rails but all blocks the railroad is made of.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>3.3	Claim blocking.</b><br/>
                “Claim blocking” is referring to the act of deliberately placing claims near a town in order to block its expansion. This includes placing a new town next to another with the intent of blocking their expansion.<br/>
                <br>
                <img height="280" src="img/claimBlockExample1.jpg"/><img height="280" src="img/claimBlockExample2.jpg"/><img height="280" src="img/claimBlockExample3.jpg"/>
                <br/>
                A town's claims count as blocking if they create long arms of claims protruding from their town like in the images above. These arms are an issue as they do not only block existing towns but also take up large areas where future towns could otherwise be created.<br>
                <br>
                Only mayors of towns being claim blocked may report breaking the rule as claiming along someone's border is fine if all involved towns agree on it.<br>
                <br>
                All claims which staff concludes to be blocking a town will be removed without any refund. Players found to be claim blocking more than once may be warned and denied the ability to place outposts all together.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>3.4  Stealing specific blocks.</b><br/>
                Stealing specific blocks for their value is not considered grief and is therefore allowed. This does not apply to easily acquired blocks even if they are valuable to you.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>3.5  Major terraforming.</b><br/>
                In order to preserve the accurate geography of the map, major terraforming projects are not allowed. In general, if your edits of the landscape alter the Dynmap view of the natural landscape, they will be removed.
                Examples of this includes for instance draining large lakes/rivers, creating artificial islands which do not exist in real life, or covering the ocean with platforms.
            </li>

        <h2>4. Naming</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>4.1  Nation names.</b><br/>
                Before creating a nation, make sure your name complies with the nation naming rules. Nation names may be changed by a staff member if rule is not followed and may be disbanded if the rule is repeatedly broken.
                <ul class="innerul">
                    <li>Nation name cannot be fictional. It has to have the same name as a current or past nation.</li>
                    <li>Nation can be named after region, province or other large geographical area with defined borders if accurate nation name is already taken.</li>
                    <li>Nation name must correspond with map location of the nation capital.</li>
                    <li>Nation cannot have a similar name to already established nation to the point where one could easily be confused with the other.</li>
                    <li>Nation cannot be named after unions.</li>
                    <li>Nation cannot be named after alliances.</li>
                    <li>Nation cannot be named after a continent.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>4.2	Town names.</b><br/>
                Before creating a town, make sure your name complies with the town naming rules. Town names may be changed by a staff member if rule is not followed.
                <ul class="innerul">
                    <li>Fictional town names are allowed. However, we highly recommend towns to have a name tied to the real life town location.</li>
                    <li>Town name cannot be inappropriate/toxic/offensive.</li>
                    <li>Town cannot be named after a region which qualifies as a nation name.</li>
                    <li>Town cannot have a similar name to already established town to the point where one could easily be confused with the other.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			<li>
                <b>4.3	Nicknames, Minecraft usernames and Towny titles</b><br/>
                Do not use explicit, sexual, racist or otherwise inappropriate nicknames, Minecraft usernames or Towny titles.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How and where do I appeal my punishment?</h3>
        <p>
            You have the chance to appeal for any punishments provided by staff. To do so visit our dedicated discord server for appeals found <a href="https://discord.gg/PEAJt9s">here</a> (this server is different from our main discord server).
            After stating the reason for your ban and your in-game username you will be provided a text channel where you will be able to explain yourself and the situation to staff.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I report a player breaking the rules?</h3>
        <p>
            Please join our main discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/vJTta6M">here</a> and start a new support ticket by running the command “-new”. A separate text channel will be provided named after your ticket number.
            You do not have to wait for staff to reply here, instead provide as much evidence as you have of the player and which rules are broken from the list above.
        </p>

        <h3>Who is a player and who does above rules apply to?</h3>
        <p>
            Everyone playing on EarthMC Minecraft server or anyone part of our discord server is a player. Players cover all ranks.
        </p>

        <h3>Who is staff?</h3>
        <p>
            Anyone who holds the Mod, Admin and Owner rank is considered staff. Plugin developers are not staff although they may have access to support tickets so they can use your feedback to improve their plugins.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I report staff abuse?</h3>
        <p>
            EarthMC has zero tolerance for staff abuse. Please contact Fix#0001 or KarlofDuty#5275 through discord and provide as much evidence as possible.
